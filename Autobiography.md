            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My educational journey began at Pili Elementary School, where I started kindergarten at the young age of four. Those formative years provided a strong foundation, and I proudly graduated from there before moving on to Madridejos National High School, fondly known as MNHS. At MNHS, I not only completed my high school education but also developed a deep appreciation for teamwork, critical thinking, literature.</p>
            <p>Continuing my academic pursuits, I attended Babag 1 National High School for senior high, where I specialized in HUMSS. This experience equipped me with  advanced problem-solving skills, a strong understanding of business principles, a passion for social sciences. Currently, I am furthering my education at Lapu-Lapu City College, where I am pursuing a degree in IT. Each step of my educational path has contributed to shaping my aspirations and preparing me for future challenges.</p>
