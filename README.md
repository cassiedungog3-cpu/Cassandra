            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My educational journey began at Pili Elementary School, where I started kindergarten at the young age of four. Those formative years provided a strong foundation, and I proudly graduated from there before moving on to Madridejos National High School, fondly known as MNHS. At MNHS, I not only completed my high school education but also developed a deep appreciation for teamwork, critical thinking, literature.</p>
            <p>Continuing my academic pursuits, I attended Babag 1 National High School for senior high, where I specialized in HUMSS. This experience equipped me with  advanced problem-solving skills, a strong understanding of business principles, a passion for social sciences. Currently, I am furthering my education at Lapu-Lapu City College, where I am pursuing a degree in IT. Each step of my educational path has contributed to shaping my aspirations and preparing me for future challenges.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, my primary goal is to establish myself as a writer. Realistically, this involves several key steps: honing my writing skills through consistent practice and feedback, building a strong portfolio with diverse samples, and gaining experience through internships or freelance work. I also plan to immerse myself in the writing community, attending workshops and networking with other writers to learn from their experiences and open doors to potential opportunities. Ultimately, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the literary world by crafting stories that resonate with readers and reflect the vibrant culture of Cebu.</p>

            <h2>My Life</h2>
            <p>Today has been one of those days filled with a mix of emotions and challenges. Circumstances have brought about moments of sadness, reminding me of the obstacles that life often throws our way. It's a stark reminder that the path to achieving my goals isn't always smooth, and sometimes, unexpected setbacks can make the journey feel overwhelming. However, I'm trying to keep in mind that these moments, though difficult, are also opportunities for growth and resilience.</p>
            <p>Despite the challenges, I remain determined to keep moving forward. The difficulties I face today are fueling my resolve to work even harder towards my goals. I believe that every obstacle overcome is a step closer to realizing my aspirations. While it's okay to acknowledge the sadness and frustration, I'm committed to channeling these feelings into positive action and using them as motivation to create a brighter future for myself.</p>
